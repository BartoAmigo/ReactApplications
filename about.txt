This file contains the reason why im learning like this.
********************************************************
I enjoy coding and when it comes time to answer questions
about React, I will know things that people wouldn't know
just by following youtube tutorials. There is nothing wrong
with following youtube tutorials except for the fact you are
learning a coder's syntax. You are learning how a coder writes
in other words you are coding like somebody else. Learning the
basics of a library and language allows you to be more creative. 
I want to be as creative as I can be because thats what makes coding
fun for me. 
This file contains simple applications and notes about React.
NO DISRESPECT ON PEOPLE WHO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND LEARN HOW TO CODE
WE ALL HAVE DONE IT.
